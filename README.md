**DMP** (or _Dice My Pass_) is a simple passphrase generator that gives you a passphrase of the desired length using [EFF's long wordlist](http://eff.org/dice). This little tool was used to create a blog post on how to create a Ruby gem at codingdose.info (WIP)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dmp'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dmp

## Usage

### You can use it as a library in your code.
```ruby
irb(main):001:0> require 'dmp'
=> true
irb(main):002:0> Dmp.gen_passphrase(4)
=> ["discount", "stove", "rubbing", "underage"]
```

### Or you can use the CLI if you want to execute it in the terminal.

**Generate a passphrase**
```
$ dmp
- Passphrase: bagpipe sprinkled unscented trespass splice outlet headlamp
```

**Generate a passphrase and copy it to the clipboard**
```
- Passphrase: reconvene glimmer treading swerve zebra visibly veal
- Copied to clipboard.
```

**Generate a passphrase of your desired length**
```
$ dmp gen 5
- Passphrase: tavern silly afar luncheon cement
```

**Help**
```
Commands:
  dmp about           # Displays version number and information
  dmp gen [length]    # Generate a passphrase of the desired length.
