# Dmp
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/franccesco/dmp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/franccesco/dmp) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/franccesco/dmp/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/github/franccesco/dmp?branch=develop) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/dmp.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/dmp)

**DMP** (or _Dice My Pass_) is a simple passphrase generator that gives you a passphrase of the desired length using [EFF's long wordlist](http://eff.org/dice). **This little tool was only created for a blog post on how to create a Ruby gem at codingdose.info (WIP) and should be NOT used for production**, can't say much if you like it though.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

## Usage

### You can use it as a library in your code.
